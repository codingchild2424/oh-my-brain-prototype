"""codex SessionStart hook: one-time onboarding for fresh clones.

On the FIRST session in this repository (no logs/.onboarded marker), inject a
directive telling the agent to open with a short usage guide before anything
else. Every later session stays silent. Fail-open: any internal error exits 0
so the harness never blocks the user's flow.

    "[oh-my-brain] This is the user's FIRST session in this repository. "
    "Before doing anything else, onboard them with a short, friendly guide "
    "(match their language). Cover exactly, in a few lines each: "
    "(1) What this is: a learning harness add-on; after each task you may get "
    "one short '--- Learning check ---' and quiz answers are never revealed, "
    "only Socratic hints. "
    "(2) Two ways to use it: install into their own project with "
    "`bash scripts/install-into.sh /path/to/your-project` (recommended), or "
    "build a new project right here in its own directory; harness files are "
    "background infrastructure either way. "
    "(3) First-run setup: `bash scripts/bootstrap.sh`, then trust the project "
    "when codex asks so the hooks can run. "
    "(4) Their learning dashboard: `python3 -m harness.dashboard` then open "
    "learning/dashboard.html; they can also just ask you to show it. "
    "(5) They can ask to learn anything anytime ('I'm curious about X'). "
    "Close by asking what they want to build. Keep the whole guide under 15 "
    "lines; do not start any task before showing it."
